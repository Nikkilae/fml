# FML repository documentation

This repository consists of a few separate projects. More detailed documentation on each project can be found in their own readmes:

| Directory | |
|-|-|
| [`/Example`](/Example) | A minimal example GameMaker project for using FML. |
| [`/FmlLib`](/FmlLib) | A C++ project that creates the shared library (.dll/.so/etc) referred to by the FML GameMaker extension asset. FmlLib interfaces with the FMOD library. |
| [`/FmlYy`](/FmlYy) | A GameMaker project where the FML extension is written. In this project there are also automated tests. |
| [`/TestFmodStudioProject`](/TestFmodStudioProject) | An FMOD Studio project to create the banks used by the automated tests in [/FmlYy](/FmlYy). |
| [`/docs`](/docs) | Source code of the [FML user documentation](https://nikkilae.github.io/fml), partially auto-generated by [/fml-docs-generator](/fml-docs-generator). |
| [`/fml-docs-generator`](/fml-docs-generator) | A Rust project to generate parts of the user documentation in [/docs](/docs), particularly the API Reference parts. Reads and parses the [/FmlYy](/FmlYy) in order to generate the documentation. |
| [`/fml-extension-generator`](/fml-extension-generator) | A Rust project to auto-generate parts of the extension in [/FmlYy](/FmlYy). Reads and parses [/FmlLib](/FmlLib) to find all the functions that are to be provided by the extension. |

---

The projects are very much tied together and especially some of the tooling like fml-docs-generator and fml-extension-generator are hard coded to work with only this project instead of being general purpose tools.

> TODO: Write a general overview of the project and how the sub-projects work together!
