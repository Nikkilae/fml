## [`/FmlLib`](/FmlLib)

## [`/fml-docs-generator`](/fml-docs-generator)

A Rust project to generate parts of the user documentation in [/docs](/docs), particularly the API Reference parts. Reads and parses the [/FmlYy](/FmlYy) in order to generate the documentation.

## [`/fml-extension-generator`](/fml-extension-generator)
