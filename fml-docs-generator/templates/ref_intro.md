# API Reference

This is a mostly full reference of the entirety of the FML API. It's partially autogenerated from source code.

Because FML is a somewhat one-to-one reflection of the FMOD API, this documentation does not explain what the functions do. For each function of FML, there's very likely one with almost the same name in the FMOD API, so you can go and see its documentation in the FMOD API instead. Next to most of the entries in this API reference is a link to the corresponding entry in the FMOD API documentation website.

This API reference currently only covers constructors and functions. It does not cover for example some constants yet, but that'll probably come later! For now, because enums and constants are named mostly with the exact same name as they are in the FMOD C++ API, you can refer to the FMOD API for those.
