# **FML** *(GML bindings to the FMOD API)*

FML is an extension for [GameMaker](https://gamemaker.io) that provides GML bindings to a subset of the [FMOD](https://www.fmod.com/) API.

There are two separate documentations depending on what you're looking for:

| The user documentation is for you if you want to use FML in your GameMaker project. |

| <u>[Repository documentation](/repo_docs.md)</u> |
| :--- |
| The repository documentation for you if you wish to know about the source code of the FML extension itself and maybe even contribute to it. |
