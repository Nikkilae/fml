# **FML**

*GML bindings to the FMOD API*

<br/>

FML is an extension for [GameMaker](https://gamemaker.io) that provides GML bindings to a subset of the [FMOD](https://www.fmod.com/) API.

It's a set of one-to-one bindings to the FMOD API, focusing on covering the [FMOD Studio API](https://www.fmod.com/docs/2.02/api/studio-guide.html) but also providing a small subset of the [FMOD Core API](https://www.fmod.com/docs/2.02/api/core-guide.html).

FML itself (excluding the included FMOD libraries) is licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/Nikkilae/fml/blob/main/LICENSE) so it's free to use. Do keep in mind that when using FML, you're also using FMOD which has its [own licensing](https://www.fmod.com/licensing).

FMOD API coverage: Most of [FMOD Studio API](https://www.fmod.com/docs/2.02/api/studio-guide.html) and a little bit of [FMOD Core API](https://www.fmod.com/docs/2.02/api/core-guide.html).

FMOD API version: `2.02.10`

Supported GameMaker versions: `v2022.6.26` and beyond.
<br/>*Maybe some previous versions too? I haven't tried but go for it!*

Supported platforms: `Windows` and `Ubuntu` (VM & YYC, x64 only).
<br/>*More platforms may be supported in the future but no promises. [Details](https://nikkilae.github.io/fml/#/README?id=state-of-development)*

The project that is used to develop FML is on GameMaker IDE v2022.6.26, Runtime v2022.6.1.40, which means that that version of GameMaker works for sure. I've also tested it on the LTS IDE v2022.0.0.19, Runtime v2022.0.0.12 which works too, so I assume that any version between these two probably works.
