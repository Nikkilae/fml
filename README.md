# **FML**

*GML bindings to the FMOD API*

<br/>

FML is an extension for [GameMaker](https://gamemaker.io) that provides GML bindings to a subset of the [FMOD](https://www.fmod.com/) API.

It's a set of one-to-one bindings to the FMOD API, focusing on covering the [FMOD Studio API](https://www.fmod.com/docs/2.02/api/studio-guide.html) but also providing a small subset of the [FMOD Core API](https://www.fmod.com/docs/2.02/api/core-guide.html).

FML itself (excluding the included FMOD libraries) is licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/Nikkilae/fml/blob/main/LICENSE) so it's free to use. Do keep in mind that when using FML, you're also using FMOD which has its [own licensing](https://www.fmod.com/licensing).
