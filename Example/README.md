| [`./ExampleGm`](/ExampleCpp) | A minimal example GameMaker project for using FML. |
| [`./ExampleCpp`](/ExampleCpp) | A C++ example that does the same thing that the GM example project does but using the FMOD libraries directly. This may be useful as a reference in case you already know the FMOD library and are now figuring out how it maps into FML. |
| [`./ExampleFmodStudioProject`](/ExampleCpp) | An FMOD Studio project that is used to create the banks used by the example projects. |
